## HESTON MODEL

The Heston Stochastic Volatility Model simulates asset prices and variance under stochastic volatility, capturing volatility smiles and clustering. This project calibrates the Heston model to SPXW ATM call IVs from 1-minute SPX/SPXW data (May 15â€“31, 2024) using Inverse Black-Scholes, applies filters for valid option prices (>0) and time to expiration (7-60 days), and prices options via Monte Carlo simulation. It forecasts volatility paths, visualizes price/volatility simulations, and exports results to Excel. Applications include options pricing, volatility forecasting, and arbitrage
