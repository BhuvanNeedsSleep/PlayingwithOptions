# GARCH(1,1) Volatility Forecasting on SPX

This project implements a **GARCH(1,1)** model to forecast daily volatility of the **S&P 500 Index (SPX)** based on historical returns.

##  Why GARCH?

GARCH models (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) are widely used in finance to:

- Capture **volatility clustering** observed in financial returns
- Forecast **conditional volatility** dynamically over time
- Improve **risk management**, option pricing, and trading strategies

## What This Code Does

The GARCH(1,1) model forecasts implied volatility (IV) by modeling its time-series variance, capturing volatility clustering in financial markets. This code applies GARCH(1,1) to SPXW call option IVs derived from 1-minute SPX/SPXW data via Inverse Black-Scholes. It filters for valid option prices (>0) and time to expiration (7-60 days), fits the model to daily ATM IVs across multiple trading days (May 15â€“31, 2024), and forecasts future IV with confidence intervals. Results are visualized and exported to Excel, demonstrating advanced volatility modeling and time-series analysis.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- `arch` (for GARCH modeling)
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`

## Input

- Historical SPX prices in CSV format with columns: `Date`, `Close`
